<h1>Description</h1>
<pre>
This Project is part of Data Science Nanodegree Program by Udacity in collaboration with Figure Eight.
The  dataset contains pre-labelled tweets and messages from real-life disaster. 
The aim of the project is to build a NLP tool an ML pipeline  that categorize messages and displays in the web app.

The Project is divided in the following Sections:

1. Data Pre-processing, ETL Pipeline to extract data from source, clean data and save them in a proper database. 
2. Machine Learning Pipeline to train a model that is able to classify text messages into categories
3. Web App to show model results in real time.

<h1>Project Motivation</h1>
<pre>

It's really important that our emergency calls are responded and help is sent out fast.
Inorder to achieve this,the messages are to be devided according to the respective departments.
Yah You guessed it right!This project does that.   Â

<div id="Execution">
<pre>
1. Run the following commands in the project's root directory to set up your database and model.

    - To run ETL pipeline that cleans data and stores in database
        `python data/process_data.py data/disaster_messages.csv data/disaster_categories.csv data/DisasterResponse.db`
    - To run ML pipeline that trains classifier and saves
        `python models/train_classifier.py data/DisasterResponse.db models/classifier.pkl`

2. Run the following command in the app's directory to run your web app.
    `python run.py`

3. Go to http://0.0.0.0:3001/
